Examples of how C++11 can be used with DDS, notably with OpenSplice DDS.

To enable C++11 support in OpenSplice DDS please copy the file:

    ./make/Makefile.Build_DCPS_ISO_Cpp_Lib

under ${OSPL_HOME}/custom_lib and then do the following:

$cd ${OSPL_HOME}/custom_lib
$ make -f Makefile.Build_DCPS_ISO_Cpp_Lib

At thi point you are reading to start enjoing C++11 and DDS.
